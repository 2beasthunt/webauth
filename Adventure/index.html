<dt style="background-color: orange; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align:center"> Day 1 - July 7th, 2023
    Normandy Beach, France - Omaha Landing</dt> 
    <dd style="background-color:burlywood; text-align:center">We stopped at Normandy Beach, our first day in France. It was a captivating place to visit. You feel the sand where brave men fought for the freedom from the Nazis. You walk where they walked, it is a surreal feeling. From the beach, you see where the machine gun nests used to lay, now it has an indimidating and ominous feeling, as if they are looming down upon you.IMAGE The tourguide had given us insight on what some slang was used by the soldiers. For example, an Army Banjo, was a shovel. They used this to dig trenches and get through the sea wall. Another was a chatterbox. This is what they had called machine guns.</dd>
<dt style="background-color: orange; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align:center"><strong> Day 3 - July 9th, 2023 Auschwitz</strong></dt>
<dd style="background-color:burlywood; text-align:center">Next stop was <em>Auschwitz</em>. This was the hardest of all to grasp. This place has a certain feeling to it. It is a terrible, horrible, and dreadful feeling. It feels as though you can help those who were there, but you choose not to. Or rather, you cannot. Because you weren't there. And they are not here today.IMAGE</dd>
<dt style="background-color: orange; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align:center">Day 5 - July 11th, 2023  Anne Frank House</dt>
    <dd style="background-color:burlywood; text-align:center;">This house is an amazing place. The old factor it sits on top of. Everything in the city has history behind it, whether it be from the Nazi Regime or not. The annex was cold and dimly lit. You can feel the creativity coming from this space. I remebered the history books we read in school, telling all about this place. We even read her diary which had been published. It was truly an amazing piece. IMAGE</dd>
